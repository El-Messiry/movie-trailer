1. **`fresh_tomatoes.py`** is a ready file from this [repository](https://github.com/udacity/ud036_StarterCode) . It has a **`open_movie_page()`** function that will take in your list of movies and generate an HTML file including this content, producing a website to showcase your favorite movies

- **`fresh_tomatoes.html`** is ready **HTML** code used by `fresh_tomatoes.py`  to build the webpage on your browser

- **`media.py`**   is a movie class that takes movie's `name `, `story line` , `link to image` , `link of youtube trailer` 

- **`entertainment_center.py`** by calling the constructor **`media.Movie()`** to instantiate movie objects. Youâ€™ve given movies their own custom data structure by defining the movie class and constructor, and now these objects can be stored in a list data structure. This list of movies is what the **`open_movies_page()`** function needs as input in order to build the **HTML** file, so you can display the website.
